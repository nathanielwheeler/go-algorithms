# Go Algorithms

This repo is where I practice my algorithms.  Many of these repos are inspired by [Jon Calhoun's algorithms course](https://www.calhoun.io/lets-learn-algorithms/), although I also intend to to make some original scripts.  I am also taking the opportunity to gain more familiarity with [Go's testing package](https://godoc.org/testing).

I am using cobra CLI to call algorithms from the command line.
